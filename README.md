UO CIT 281 - Project 2

Project: Project 2 focused on JS and git commiting. We went through multiple iterations of file and would commit at different stages. We utilized the '-m' feature to help keep track of what we changed. This was also the first time where we experiemented with staging files before committing them. To do this, we used the Source Control tab in VS Code. This allowed us to see what files were staged, and which ones were not in a simple and easy to read format.

Lab: Lab 2 built off of Lab 1. We initialized git using 'git init', and then new file to this git Repository. Next, we went through the process of adding and comitting files. Along with this, we practiced using '.gitignore' to ignore files that we did not want to commit. Additionally, we learned how clone cloud repos locally. We also practiced branching these repos to test new features.
